<h1>SIAM-Simons Undergraduate Summer Research Program</h1>
<p>
  The Summer of 2023 I took an internship at Rice University through the Societu of Industrial and Applied mathematics (SIAM) that was funded 
  by the Simon's foundation. There I worked with mentor Professor Illya Hicks and student Rachel Ahumada who attends Azusa Pacific University.
  During the internship, we coded Dijkstra's all pairs shortest path algorithm that we then used to compute the minimum cycle basis 
  of any graph. And while we didn't make it to our end goal of pose graph optimization, we did learn about its process and its uses.
