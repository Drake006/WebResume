<h3> Summary </h3>
  <p>I am currently a college undergraduate looking to for a job that can showcase my skills. As a math tutor I learned how to communicate 
  problems better with others in order to get them to understand a certain mathematical concept. During my internship I learned how to adapt
  to situations as I bettered my problem solving skills. And as football player, I utilized the skills neccessary to work collaboratively 
  and demonstrated my dedication to put in work outside of designated practice times to be a great player. In the near future I hope to find
  a job that can allow me to put the skills that I have gained through life experiences to good use. </p>
